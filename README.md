# Cabin of Bliss

It's a responsive website made for learning. I intend to use it as a playground to practice frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Possibly without third-party libraries and frameworks.

## To-do:

- Expand the homepage 
- Make About and Contact pages
- Build the blog from scratch
- Create booking and contact forms
- Add more pages and features as I continue my learning journey
